## 🔹 Overview

This project is a **machine learning solution for email spam detection**, using **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes**. The system leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert email text into numerical features.  

**Random Forest** achieved **100% accuracy** on training data and is used for live deployment.  

📌 **Goal:** Protect inboxes by automatically detecting and filtering spam emails.

## 🔹 Dataset

- **Required columns:**  
  - `text` → email content  
  - `label` → spam or ham  

- **Sample Data:**

| Email Text                   | Label |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Free money now!!!             | spam  |
| Meeting at 10am tomorrow      | ham   |
