## 🔹 Overview

This project is a **machine learning solution for email spam detection**, using **Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes**. The system leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert email text into numerical features.  

**Random Forest** achieved **100% accuracy** on training data and is used for live deployment.  

📌 **Goal:** Protect inboxes by automatically detecting and filtering spam emails.
